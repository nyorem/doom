* Basic shortcuts
- SPC : = M-x
- SPC . = find file in current directory
** File manipulation
- C-x d = dired
- SPC o - = launch dired with directory containing current buffer
- SPC f r = find file in recent files
- SPC f p = file in file private config
- SPC f D = delete current file
** Help
- SPC h w = command -> keyboard shortcut
- SPC h v = describe variable
- SPC h k = describe key
- SPC h f = describe function
- SPC h e = *Messages* buffer
- K = help of thing under cursor
** Buffers
- SPC , = switch between buffers
- SPC x = create a scratch buffer
- SPC b B = see all buffers
- SPC b k = kill buffer
- SPC b p/n = previous/next buffer
- SPC b i = ibuffer => all buffers
- SPC b N = create new buffer
- SPC b Z = kill all buried buffers
** Terminal
- SPC o t = open terminal at the bottom
  need to install libtool-bin package first
- SPC o T = open terminal in new window
** Restarting
- SPC q d = restart Emacs server
- SPC q K = kill Emacs daemon and clients
- SPC q q = quit Emacs
- SPC h r r = doom reload
** Window manipulation
- SPC w C-o = vim's <C-w>o
- SPC w = = make windows the same size
** Misc
- SPC f T = make the current frame fullscreen
- g f = open a link
- C-n/C-p for code/text completion
- SPC i s = insert snippet
- SPC m e b = eval-buffer
* dired
- SPC . = create file
- + = create directory
- d = mark files as to be deleted
- x = delete files
- t = toggle
- u = unselect
- U = unselect all
- m = mark
- C = copy file
- R = rename/move
- i + :w = rename files and directories

** Advanced
- o = change sort order
- M = change mode
- O = change owner
- */ = select all directories
- ( = switch between simple and full view
- M-RET = preview file
* projectile
- SPC SPC = find file in project
- SPC p a = add project
- SPC p d = remove known project
- SPC p i = invalidate cache for current project
- SPC p p = switch between projects
- SPC p R = run command in project root
- SPC p r = find file in project recent files
- SPC s p = search across the whole project
  Use C-c C-e to transform the list of results into a wgrep buffer on which you can act (:w to write with vertico, C-C C-C with helm)
  (see https://hungyi.net/posts/doom-emacs-search-replace-project/)
* magit
- SPC g g = git status
- SPC g C = git clone
- SPC g B = git blame ('q' to quit)
- SPC g f c = show commit
- c c/c a = commit/amend
- F p = pull from remote
- P p = push to remote
- g z = refresh git status window
- P -f p = push force to remote
- s = create a "spin-off" branch
  Check https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Branch-Commands.html for more details
- Z z = stash
- ' = submodule actions
  add C-u to target all submodules
- C-c C-c to fixup on commit/start interactive rebase on commit
- C-c C-c in popup windows to save arguments across sessions
- y b = copy buffer revision
- A A = cherry pick
* flyspell
- need to install aspell + aspell-en/aspell-fr dictionaries first
- SPC t s = toggle spell checking on file
- M-x ispell-change-dictionary to choose which dictionary to use
- z = to check spelling of word under cursor
* org-mode
- SHIFT TAB to expand/hide everything
- M-h/M-l/M-j/M-k to move the item one level up or down
- M-RET/C-RET creates another headline/list entry with the same level (control puts you in insert mode)
- S-up to increase priority (no priority = B), called "priority cookies" in org-mode
- SPC o a t = open agenda with all TODOs
- SPC m e = org export dispatcher
- SPC m r r = refile
- C-C C-c to convert between an unordered and an ordered list
** Links
- SPC m l l = create a link
  *Headline (if targetting the same file)
  file:<FILE>::<line number>
  file:<FILE>::<Headline>
  elisp:<code>
  shell:<command>
- SPC n l = store link under cursor
** Code snippets
- <s TAB to create a snippet
- SPC m ' = open snippet in another buffer to edit it
  C-c C-c when done
- C-C C-c to execute the snippet
** Tags
- SPC m t <tag> = convert headline to <tag>
- SPC o a t = list all TODOs in all org files (listed by priority)
- SPC m q = add a tag (tags are inherited)
- SPC o a m = list tasks with tags in agenda
** Checkboxes
- No tag and priority can be attached
- RET = change the state (not started, in progress, done)
- SPC m x = toggle checkbox
- [/] or [%] + C-c C-c to add a "cookie" to track the number of tasks done
** Capturing
- SPC X to start a capture
* C++
- SPC p g = configure project
- SPC p c = compile project
- SPC p F = find file in an *other* project
- SPC p T = run tests
  Use C-SPC to mark tests to run
- SPC c d = find definition
- SPC c D = find references
- SPC c a = code action
- SPC c f = format region/buffer
- SPC c r = rename variable/function name in all project files
- SPC c x = see list of errors
- SPC i s = insert a snippet
* Python
- Install the LSP with:
  #+begin_src sh
  pip3 install python-language-server
  #+end_src
* Emacs Lisp
- SPC h d d = set debug mode
- SPC h i = open manuals
- gr = eval region
- gR = eval-buffer
- SPC o r = REPL
- SPC o R = open REPL in the same window
- To get access to a lot of Common Lisp standard functions:
  #+begin_src elisp
 (require 'cl)
  #+end_src
* evil-snipe
- f/F  = same as vim's f but pressing it repeatedly allow to go to next occurrences

* evil-multiedit
- M-d/M-D to select next/previous occurrence
- RET to exclude it/put it back
- R to select all occurrences (visual mode)
* avy
- g s SPC = find a word in all opened buffers using Avy
  x/X = to delete selection ('X' doesn't move the cursor)
  i = use ispell to correct the word
  y = copy word
  t = teleport/move word
